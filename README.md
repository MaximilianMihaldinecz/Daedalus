# Daedalus
A console based labyrinth game (c++)
Daedalus is terminal-based labyrinth game, where the userâ€™s goal to find his way out before his life points run out. 

#Playing the game
The user can play with three different characters, each of them having a unique power. The user can also select between difficulty levels, which results in different sized, randomly generated labyrinth to play with. The program offers the options to save the current labyrinth to disk or load one from it. A labyrinth can be made up of three types of rooms: one which decreases the health, one which increases the health, and a neutral one. Each room has a random number of paths leading to other rooms, or to the exit eventually. The program ensures that all the generated labyrinths have at least one path which leads from start to the exit. At the end of each game, the player will be presented with some statistical data about his performance.
